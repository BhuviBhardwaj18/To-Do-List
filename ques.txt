    "question": "You are an operating system scheduling 5 tasks: A, B, C, D, and E. You are given these dependencies. A task can only run once all the tasks it depends on have finished:\n\n* Task A depends on nothing.\n* Task B depends on A and C.\n* Task C depends on D.\n* Task D depends on A.\n* Task E depends on B and D.\n\nQuestion: What is the shortest possible order of task completion (a valid schedule) that satisfies all dependencies? (List the tasks in order, e.g., A, C, B, D, E)",
